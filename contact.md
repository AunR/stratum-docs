## Questions about Pricing
Datica now provides public pricing on our [pricing page](https://datica.com/pricing). If you have any additional questions about pricing, please reach out to our sales team: [sales@datica.com](mailto:sales@datica.com).

## The Platform Support
Existing customers should contact Datica Support by logging into the [The Platform dashboard](https://product.datica.com/compliant-cloud) and clicking on "Contact Support" for the environment with which they need support. We do this to ensure the integrity of the request and validate the user's ACL.

Tickets can also be made via this [form](https://datica.com/support) if you do not have a Platform login or are otherwise having issues with dashboard.

In addition, please review the support sections of our Service Level Agreement [here](https://legal.datica.com/#service-level-and-support-agreement).

`Datica shall provide Customer support, which shall be available Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. To 5:00 p.m. Central time, excluding holidays.`

### Emergency Support
For **Growth** plan customers as well as customers with environments provisioned previous to the The Platform 3.0 release, Datica provides emergency off-hours support for Severity 1 issues as outlined [here](https://legal.datica.com/#3-service-maintenance). A Datica engineer is on call from 5:00PM CST to 9:00AM CST the following morning. If an environment is experiencing a Severity 1 issue, file a support ticket via one of the following methods:

- Submit a ticket through the [The Platform Dashboard](https://product.datica.com/) with priority "Urgent"
- Call (888) 377-3184 and leave a message with your contact information

Either of these methods will page our on-call engineer, who will respond in under an hour to begin to resolve an issue. If necessary, the engineer will initiate a call with the customer to assist with the resolution of the problem.
