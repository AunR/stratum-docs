# Stratum Supported Languages and Frameworks

The general rule of thumb to follow is that if it is supported by Heroku, it is supportable by Catalyze. The listing of languages / frameworks supported by Heroku is listed [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/language-support). In summary, here is the listing:


- [Ruby](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)
- [Clojure](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-clojure)
- [Python](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python)
- [Java](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-java)
- [Gradle](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-gradle)
- [Grails](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-grails)
- [Scala](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-scala)
- [Play](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-play)
- [PHP](https://github.com/CHH/heroku-buildpack-php)

## Third-Party Buildpacks

There are many third-party buildpacks available for use. Some of these buildpacks tweak existing language packs, others carry out a specific function that other buildpacks cannot do.

While Catalyze does not officially support non-Heroku buildpacks, many of them will work on the Stratum platform.
