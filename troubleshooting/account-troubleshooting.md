# Account Management Troubleshooting

## Environment Access

**I can see my new environment but I can't view details in the The Platform dashboard**

- **Potential Issue** You may not have permission to access the environment.
- **Potential Solution** The admin or owner of your [organization](/compliant-cloud/articles/concepts/organizations/) must grant you permission to access the environment.

## Organization Access
**I can't see my organization**

- **Potential Issue** You have an account but are not part of an organization.
- **Potential Solution** You must be invited to your organization by an admin or owner. If your organization has not been created, you may need to contact Datica support.  If your organization has been created, the owner or admin must send you an invite. See the [organizations guide](/compliant-cloud/articles/concepts/organizations/) for more details.

## Locked out of your Account

**I have been locked out of my Datica account**

- **Potential Issue** You may have exceeded the number of allowed incorrect password attempts or suspicious behavior has been detected for your account.
- **Potential Solution** Contact [Datica support](/compliant-cloud/articles/contact/) to unlock your account.
