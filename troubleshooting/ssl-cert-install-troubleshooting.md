# SSL Cert Install Troubleshooting

## SSL Certificate Renwal
- * My SSL certificate has or is going to expire and needs to be updated*
1.  Obtain your updated SSL certificates
2. [Update your certificates](https://resources.catalyze.io/stratum/articles/guides/self-service-SSL/) using the Catalyze CLI by using the [certs update](https://resources.catalyze.io/paas/paas-cli-reference/certs/#certs-update) command
3. Redeploy your service proxy for your certificate update to take effect. To [redeploy](/paas/paas-cli-reference#redeploy) your service proxy via CLI use the command  `catalyze redeploy service_proxy`

- ** Note: ** Depending on what kind of environment you have, the ability to redeploy your service proxy may not be enabled. Contact us at [support@catalyze.io](mailto:support@catalyze.io). Or open a Zendesk ticket and Catalyze support will redeploy your service proxy and re-enable service proxy redeploys for your environment.

## Common SSL Questions
- *Question* Does the CSR need to be generated by Catalyze?
- *Answer* No, you can generate the CSR. Instructions on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9446/0/apache-opensslmodsslnginx).

- *Question* Why does my certificate not working for all of my applications?
- *Answer* Depending on the type of certificate you have, you may only be able to register one domain.  If you have a wildcard certificate it will allow you to enable ssl on all of you applications with different subdomains.

## Domain Update
- * I want to use another domain and cert for my application*

You can [create a new site](https://resources.catalyze.io/paas/paas-cli-reference/#sites-create) for your applicaton using the CLI.
Next you must [create a new cert](https://resources.catalyze.io/paas/paas-cli-reference/#certs-create) for your application.
