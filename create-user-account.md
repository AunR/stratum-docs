# Registering for a Platform Account
Registering for an account is always done through the [platform registration page](https://product.datica.com/environments/register). User's that have been invited to an existing organization must have a Platform account **before** accepting an invitation. Registering for an account is completely free, so we always suggest doing that right away. Additionally, new customers looking to create a free trial should register before on-boarding.

If you already have an account, continue on to the next step.

# Receive an Invitation from an Organization Admin or Owner
An organization admin or owner must invite you to the organization. Instructions for sending invites are in the [Organizations article](/compliant-cloud/articles/concepts/organizations)

# Accept Invitation
Once invited, you will receive an email that looks like this:

![email](images/account_email.png)

The email contains two options for accepting the invitation:

## Option 1: Sign In to Dashboard and Click Link
Navigate to [The Platform Dashboard](https://product.datica.com/environments) and sign in. Once signed in click the link in the email to accept the invitation.

## Option 2: Accept invite via the CLI
Copy and paste the CLI command from the e-mail into your terminal window:

`datica invites accept your-invite-code-here`
