# Stratum Troubleshooting Guide

Welcome to the Stratum troubleshooting guide. In this guide we will give you an overview of common issues users may see when working the platform. Beyond that we'll walk you through common resolutions for these issues.

## Components

In order to help you resolve your issue, we first need to outline the components of Stratum. At a high level Stratum is comprised of:

- [Stratum Dashboard](//product.catalyze.io/stratum)
- [Catalyze CLI](//github.com/catalyzeio/cli)
- [Account Manager](//product.catalyze.io)

The Stratum dashboard is where users can check the status of their environment and related services, manage users, and navigate to logging and monitoring.

The Catalyze CLI contains the bulk of platform functionality. For a comprehensive reference check out [this guide](//resources.catalyze.io/paas/paas-cli-reference/).

The Account Manager is where users can manage their authentication information, view and edit organization information, and find related Catalyze products.

Below we've listed common problems and resolutions for the previous components.
