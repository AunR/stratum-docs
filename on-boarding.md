# On-boarding

As of August 16th 2017, Datica now offers customers the ability to completely on-board themselves with no support intervention. That means new customers can register for an account, input their billing details, spec out their application environment, provision, and deploy. We're even giving our Developer tier customers a 14-day free trial!

**Let's get started**

## Creating an account
First you'll need to register for a Datica Platform account in order to build a new environment. To register go [here](https://product.datica.com/compliant-cloud/register) and sign up with your email and a password of your choosing. Once you sign up you'll be sent an email confirmation. Click the link in that confirmation to make your registration process complete.

## Signing in
Now that you have an account and have confirmed your email you can sign in. Once you're signed in you should see an empty dashboard similar to the image below.

## Onboarding - Introduction
Next you should click on the button in the welcome message that says "Create an environment". Once you click that you'll be taken to on-boarding. In this first view we're explaining from a highlevel what is required to on-board, which includes:

- Filling out your billing details
- Specing out your applicaiton environment
- And then finally deploying your new application

## Onboarding - Billing & Organization Creation
Once you've read through the steps necessary to on-board and are ready to continue click the "Continue" button or "Billing" in the navigation.

Now that you're on the billing tab you'll need to create a new organization. In the dropdown under "Organization:" select "Create new organization". This will present an additional input for your "Organization Name:". We use these details for billing and contracting, so it's important you use the legal name of your entity here.

After you've typed out the name of your organization the next step is to choose your plan. Developer tier plans qualify for a 14-day free trial, so long as your environment fits inside of the available infrastructure (more on that later). Growth tier plans do not qualify for a 14 day free trial, however they do receive a number of other service-level benefits. For a  more in depth view of the difference between the two plans, please see our [pricing page](https://datica.com/pricing).

Once a plan is selected you'll have access to input your billing details in the form of a credit card. **Note:** We will never charge you without clearly indicating that we are doing so. We require a credit card up front to spec out an environment, however we will not charge you until that environment is provisioned. The one exception to that rule is when a customer's environment qualifies for a 14-day free trial, for which we will not charge you until the free trial is over.
