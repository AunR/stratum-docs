# On-boarding

As of August 16th 2017, Datica now offers customers the ability to completely on-board themselves with no support intervention. That means new customers can register for an account, input their billing details, spec out their application environment, provision, and deploy. We're even giving our Developer tier customers a 14-day free trial!

First you'll need to register for a Datica Platform account in order to build a new environment. To register go [here](https://product.datica.com/compliant-cloud/register) and sign up with your email and a password of your choosing. Once you sign up you'll be sent an email confirmation. Click the link in that confirmation to make your registration process complete.

## Signing in
Now that you have an account and have confirmed your email you can sign in. Once you're signed in you should see an empty dashboard similar to the image below.
